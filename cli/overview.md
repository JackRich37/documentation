# Overview

Kit is the reference client of the MakeOS network being developed by the Make One team. It is being developed with the Go programming language. 

Kit aims to provide a client that allows you to easily interact with the network, manage keys and create third-party applications via an RPC API and an extension system.

It provides a single command-line application named `kit` that returns non-zero errors when a command produces an error. You can use `-h` or `--help` to get descriptive help text for every command.

To see a list of commands, run `kit` :

## Global Options

Kit includes persistent flags that are settable from any command. These flags allow you to set things like the home directory, git executable path and so on.

### Usage

`kit [options]`

### Options

* `-v, --version` - Returns the version information of the client.
* `--dev` - Turns on development mode.
* `--gitbin` - Provide the path to git executable for performing git operations on repositories.
* `--home` - Set the data directory of the Kit client. By default, the home data directory will be created in the machineâ€™s home directory with the name `.kit`. In dev mode, it will be named `.kit_dev`. If `--home.prefix` is set, it will be `.kit_prefix`. 
* `--net` - Set the unique network ID. This will determine what network the client can interact with. 
* `--no-colors` - Prevent the use of colors in the command output. 
* `--no-log` - Disable Kit and Tendermint loggers. 
* `-h, --help` - Print out a help message. 

## Environment Variables

Kit allows flags of all commands to be configured via the command line. For instance, to set the`--home` from the environment, use the variable `KIT_HOME` where `KIT_` is the namespace and `HOME` is the target flag.
