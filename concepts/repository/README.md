# Repository

The MakeOS network is a decentralized, censorship-resistant environment for hosting and managing  software codebases known as repositories. Currently, we are focused on supporting git repositories.

A git repository is a unit for developer collaboration. It is the place where people most people come together to build software. Developers share their contributions and interact within a repository.

In this section, we will go through the process of:

* Registering an existing repository on the network.
* Initializing a local repository and registering it to the network.
* Configuring repository governance.
* Configuring access control rules.
